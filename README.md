# MongoDB $in Operator with Empty Array

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with an empty array. The incorrect usage results in an empty result set, even when documents containing the field exist.

## The Problem

The `$in` operator is used to query documents where a field's value is present within a specified array. When this array is empty, it incorrectly returns an empty result set instead of returning all documents containing the field.

## Solution

To solve this problem, there are two primary approaches:

1. Use the `$exists` operator to check for the existence of the field:
```javascript
db.collection.find({ field: { $exists: true }});
```
2. Modify your logic to ensure that the array used in the `$in` operator is never empty.  For example, you may want to use a default value such as `[null]` if no values are available.

## Running the Code

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure that you have a MongoDB instance running and a collection named 'myCollection' with at least one document containing the field 'field'.
3. Run the `bug.js` file to observe the incorrect behavior. Then run `bugSolution.js` to see the corrected implementation.
